# Public School Datasets
Public school datasets are flattened to contain one row per agency_code or public school campus.  They merge data from all of the 55 files contained in the src-datasets.zip repository published by NCDPI.  We use the rcd_location file as the starting point for all file merges.

* **PublicSchools2018.csv** - 2643 Records, 1790 Columns
* **PublicElementarySchools2018.csv** - 1790 Records, 1790 Columns
* **PublicMiddleSchools2018.csv** - 806 Records, 1790 Columns
* **PublicHighSchools2018.csv** - 679 Records, 1790 Columns
