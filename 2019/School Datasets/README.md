# Public School Datasets
Public school datasets are flattened to contain one row per agency_code or public school campus.  They merge data from the files contained in the src-datasets.zip repository published by NCDPI.  We use the rcd_location file as the starting point for all file merges.

* **PublicSchools2019.csv** - 2702 Records, 4649 Columns
* **PublicElementarySchools2019.csv** - 1603 Records, 4649 Columns
* **PublicMiddleSchools2019.csv** - 846 Records, 4649 Columns
* **PublicHighSchools2019.csv** - 716 Records, 4649 Columns
