    "* ZIP Code data shows selected income and tax items classified by State, ZIP Code, and size of adjusted gross income. \n",
    "* Data are based on individual income tax returns filed with the IRS and are available for Tax Years 1998, 2001, and 2004 through 2016.\n",
    "* This data is aviable at: https://www.irs.gov/statistics/soi-tax-stats-individual-income-tax-statistics-zip-code-data-soi\n",
    "* We suggest mapping IRS Income Tax data for the tax year that covers a majority of a particular school year. \n",
    "* For example, you will find the tax data for 2013 in the 2013-2014 school year folder. This is why the files for NCDPI and IRS data may appear one year off.  \n",
    "* However, the data is keyed by zip code, so users may merge years however they see fit!  "
