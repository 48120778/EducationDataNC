The North Carolina Public Schools Report Card and Statistical Profiles Databases contain a large volume of information about public, charter, and alternative schools in the State of North Carolina. Information that is made publicly accessible comprises data at the school, district, and state levels. This includes statistics on student and school performance, academic growth, diversity, safety, instructor experience levels, school funding, educational attainment, and much more.

There were 17 tables of data reviewed within the North Carolina report card database. Two additional tables including racial composition statistics were subsequently located in the statistical profiles database [21]. The current database versions used for this report contain data ranging from 1990-2017. However, not all tables contain data dating back to 1990 or current as of 2017.
